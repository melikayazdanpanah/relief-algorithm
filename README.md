# relief-algorithm
this is a python project for Implementation Feature selection using Relief Algorithm.

Algorithm Structure:

1. set all weights W[A] := 0;
2. for i := 1 to m do begin
3. randomly select an instance Ri;
4. find nearest hit H and nearest miss M;
5. for A := 1 to a do
6. W[A] :=W[A]+diff(A,Ri,H)/m-diff(A,Ri,M)/m;
7. end;

# TOOLS:
1.pandas library:pd.read_csv: This is a function provided by the pandas library in Python for reading data from CSV files.
It takes the path to the CSV file as input and returns a DataFrame containing the data.
seg_data.shape, which gives the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame. 
Finally, it displays the first few rows of the DataFrame using seg_data.head(), 
allowing you to inspect the data and its structure.
2.numpy library
